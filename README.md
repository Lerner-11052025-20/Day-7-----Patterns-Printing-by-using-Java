# Day-7-----Patterns-Printing-by-using-Java
📘 Project Overview
The Day-7: Patterns Printing by using Java repository is a curated collection of Java programs that demonstrate the creation of different patterns using loops. These patterns include stars, numbers, and characters arranged in various shapes such as triangles, pyramids, and diamonds. Such exercises are instrumental in understanding nested loops and enhancing logical thinking.


✨ Features
Diverse Pattern Types: Includes star patterns (e.g., pyramids, diamonds), number patterns (e.g., Floyd's triangle, Pascal's triangle), and character patterns.

Beginner-Friendly: Each program is well-commented, making it easy for beginners to follow and understand the logic.

Modular Code Structure: Each pattern is implemented in a separate class, promoting modularity and ease of testing.

Interactive Input: Some programs accept user input to determine the size of the pattern, enhancing interactivity.

🧠 Learning Objectives
By working through this repository, you will:

Gain a solid understanding of nested loops in Java.

Learn how to manipulate control statements to achieve desired outputs.

Enhance problem-solving skills by translating visual patterns into code.

Prepare for technical interviews where pattern printing is a common question.
